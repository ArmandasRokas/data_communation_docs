The frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link. Page 55 TDM Time-division multiplexing. Time is divided into frames of fixed duration, each frame is divided into fixed number of time slots.

Page 30 node delay As packet travels from one node(host or router) to the subsequent node(host or router) along this path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path. The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay and propagation delay . TCP/IP protocol stack It is conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet. TCP/IP TCP/IP protocol stack Denial-of-service (DoS) Denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. DoS DDoS Distributed denial-of-service attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. DDoS Packet sniffing Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet is addressed. In this way, every packet, or a defined subset of packets, may be gathered for further analysis. Packet sniffing Man-in-the-middle attack Cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. MITM Circuit switching The switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection. In the jargon of telephony, this connection is called a circuit.
