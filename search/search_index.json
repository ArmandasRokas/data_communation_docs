Page 118 P2P Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. P2P . Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts.[ 1] Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Protocols in different Layer Port A port is a communication endpoint. At the software level a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process . Port This information is needed because in general a host could be running many network applications. Page 119 Socket A process sends messages into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a socket. A process is analogous to a house and its socket is analogous to its door. Page 119. HTTP The Web's applications protocol, HTTP, defines the format and sequence of messages exchanged between browsers and Web Server. HTTP is only one piece of the Web application. Page 126 Stateless Uses TCP/IP Message types: HTTP request message HTTP response message HTTP/2 Allows objects in a persistent connection to be sent in a client-specified priority order Allows a large object to be broken down into smaller pieces, and the transmission of thsose pieces to be interleaved with transmission other smaller objects, thus preventing a large object from forcing many smaller objects to wait their turn for transmission. Conditional HTTP GET Used to allow a server to only send the requested object to the client if that object has changed since the server last sent this object to the client. An HTTP request message is a so-called conditional GET message if (1) the request message uses the GET method and (2) the request message includes an If-Modified-Since : header line. GET /fruit/kiwi.gif HTTP/1.1 Host: www.exotiquecuisine.com If-modified-since: Wed, 9 Sep 2015 09:23:24 Last modified Last-Modified header is critical for object caching, both in the local client and in network cache servers(also known as proxy servers) Alternative Etag - ETag values are unique identifiers generated by the server and changed every time the object is modified. Persistent vs Non-persistent When this client-server interaction is taking place over TCP, the application developer needs to make an important decision\u2014should each request/response pair be sent over a separate TCP connection, or should all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the same TCP connection? Persistent Non persistent All of the request and their corresponding responses is sent over the same TCP connection Each request/response pair is sent over separate TCP connection Cookies Cookies allows sites to keep track of users. Cookie technology has four components: A cookie header line in the HTTP response message. A cookie header line in the HTTP request message. A cookie file kelp on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser. A back-end database at the Website Page 139 Cache/Proxy Server A Web cache - also called a proxy server - is a network entity that satisfies HTTP requests on the behalf of an origin Web server. The web cache has its own disk storage and keeps copies of recently requested objects in this storage. Web cache can substantially reduce the response time for a client request Web caches can substantially reduce traffic on an institution access link to the Internet. Page 143 What are the 4 aspects of data reliability? A reliable service is one that notifies the user if delivery fails, while an unreliable one does not notify the user if delivery fails All data is sent (no missing or duplicates bytes) The proper order Page 123 What is a server? A host, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients. Page 115 How does caching work? The browser establishes a TCP connection to the Web cache and sends an HTTP request for the object to the Web cache. The web cache checks to see if it has a copy o the object stored locally. If it does, the Web cache returns the object within an HTTP reposnse message to the client browser If the cache does not have the object, the Web cache opens TCP connection to the origin server. The Web cache then sends an HTTP request for the object into the cache-to-server TCP connection. After receiving this request, the origin server sends the object within an HTTP response to the Web cache. When the Web cache receives the object, it stores a copy in its local storage and sends a copy, within an HTTP response message, to the client browser(over the existing TCP connection between the client browser and the Web cache). SMTP SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ( SMTP ) is the principal application-layer protocol for Internet electronic mail. It uses the reliable data transfer service of TCP to transfer mail from sender's mail server to the recipient's mail server. Page 149 SMTP is a push protocol SMTP vs HTTP Parameter HTTP SMTP Port number 80 25 State Stateless - Type of TCP connection Persistent or Non-persistent Persistent Type of protocol Pull Protocol(mainly) Push Protocol Transfer Files from Web server to Web client Files from one mail server to another mail server IMAP and POP3 A user agent can\u2019t use SMTP to obtain the messages because obtaining the messages is a pull operation, whereas SMTP is a push protocol. The puzzle is completed by introducing a special mail access protocol that transfers messages from a mail server to his local PC. There are currently a number of popular mail access protocols, including Post Office Protocol\u2014Version 3 (POP3), Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP), and HTTP. With POP3 access, once a user has downloaded his messages to the local machine, he can create mail folders and move the downloaded messages into the folders. A user can then delete messages, move messages across folders, and search for messages (by sender name or subject). But this paradigm\u2014 namely, folders and messages in the local machine\u2014poses a problem for the nomadic user, who would prefer to maintain a folder hierarchy on a remote server that can be accessed from any computer. This is not possible with POP3\u2014the POP3 protocol does not provide any means for a user to create remote folders and assign messages to folders. So nothing is synchronized. IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. All emails and folders are synchronized between multiple devices. Stateless protocol In computing, a stateless protocol is a communications protocol in which no session information is retained by the receiver, usually a server. Stateless protocol CDN A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of proxy servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. Thus, CDN caches content (such as images, videos, or webpages) in proxy servers. So a company deploy CDN infrastructure with many groups of servers . In one world, distributed caches CDN does: Manages servers in multiple geographically distributed locations Stores copies of the content in its servers Directs each user request to location that will provide the best user experience. Why not only one enormous data center? If the client is far away from data center, server-to-client packets will cross many communication links, resulting huge delays for the user Same content will be likely sent many times over the same communication links A single data center represents a single point of failure(although a center center is crashed, the content could be received from one cache servers) Benefits Minimized latency CDNs can offer instant user redirections, they can assure 100 percent server availability even in the event of power failures or when there are any network and hardware issue associated with the system AWS offers advanced CDN with computations at edge, dynamic content maintain secure connections close to the requestor, firewal, protection from DDoS CDN AWS Drawbacks CDN network contains most updated static data. Hence, you may find difficulties in application development. In other words, to preview latest changes you made, you will need Internet connection as you won\u2019t have a local copy. This could be a headache for non technical writer or Blogger. Since your static content will be served from other sources, CDN demands additional DNS lookup. Using CDN, you are creating additional \u201cpoint of failure\u201d. If the CDN network goes down you may lose website visibility. Drawback CDN Use cases: Video streaming workloads benefit significantly from a content-distribution network(CDN) across multiple data centers and edges points Private CDN Third-party CDN Owned by the content provider itiself Distributed content on behalf of multiple content providers E.g. Google's CDN distributes YouTube videos Akamai, Limelight operate third-party CDN CDNs typically adopt one of two different server placement philosophies: enter deep or bring home Enter deep Bring home Philosophy Enter deep into the access networks of ISPs. Get close to end users Instead of getting inside the access ISP, these CDNs typically place their clusters in IXPs Advantages Improves user-perceived delay and throughput by decreasing the number of links and routers between the end user and the CDN server from which it receives content Lower maintenance and management overhead Disadv. maintain and manage the clusters can become challenging because of this highly distributed design higher delay and lower throughput to end users How it operates Most CDNs take advantage of DNS to intercept and redirect requests; CDN learns the IP address of the client\u2019s local DNS (LDNS) server via the client\u2019s DNS lookup. After learning this IP address, the CDN needs to select an appropriate cluster based on this IP address. CDNs generally employ proprietary cluster selection strategies: geographically closest or by performing real-time measurements of delay and loss performance. My thoughts : if client updates anything so it updates at origin server, CDN used only for fetching content. So the user fetches first the content from CDN server and if he/she needs update anything it updates direct to orgin server(the address could still be CDN server, but it will redirect to origin server) Google' CDN - three tiers of server clusters Netflix Enter deep a CDN approach that stores content in access networks, close to clients Centralized architecture vs distributed architecture Security : CENTRALIZED: If someone has access to the server with the information, any data can be added, modified and deleted. DISTRIBUTED: All data is distributed between the nodes of the network. If something is added, edited or deleted in any computer, it will be reflected in all the computers in the network. If some legal amendments are accepted, new information will be disseminated among other users throughout the network. Otherwise, the data will be copied to match the other nodes. Therefore, the system is self-sufficient and self-regulating. The databases are protected against deliberate attacks or accidental changes of information. Availability : CENTRALIZED: If there are several requests, the server can break down and no longer respond. DISTRIBUTED: Can withstand significant pressure on the network. All the nodes in the network have the data. Then, the requests are distributed among the nodes. Therefore, the pressure does not fall on a computer, but on the entire network. In this case, the total availability of the network is much greater than in the centralized one. Accessibility : CENTRALIZED: If the central storage has problems, you will not be able to obtain your information unless the problems are solved. In addition, different users have different needs, but the processes are standardized and can be inconvenient for customers. DISTRIBUTED: Given that the number of computers in the distributed network is large, DDoS attacks are possible only in case their capacity is much greater than that of the network. But that would be a very expensive attack. In a centralized model, the response time is very similar in this case. Therefore, it can be considered that distributed networks are secure. Data transfer rates: CENTRALIZED: If the nodes are located in different countries or continents, the connection with the server can become a problem. DISTRIBUTED: In distributed networks, the client can choose the node and work with all the required information. Scalability: CENTRALIZED: Centralized networks are difficult to scale because the capacity of the server is limited and the traffic can not be infinite. In a centralized model, all clients are connected to the server. Only the server stores all the data. Therefore, all requests to receive, change, add or delete data go through the main computer. But server resources are finite. As a result, he is able to carry out his work effectively only for the specific number of participants. If the number of clients is greater, the server load may exceed the limit during the peak time. DISTRIBUTED: Distributed models do not have this problem since the load is shared among several computers. Centralized vs distributed Bit torrent BitTorrent (abbreviated to BT ) is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P), which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner. BitTorrent is a tit-for-tat protocol, meaning that you have to give in order to receive. Bit torrent Typically, BitTorrent uses TCP as its transport protocol. The well known TCP port for BitTorrent traffic is 6881-6889 (and 6969 for the tracker port). The DHT extension (peer2peer tracker) uses various UDP ports negotiated by the peers. TCP Bittorrent Churn Churn refers to a large number of arriving and departing participants within a short time in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Churn Rarest first The rarest first algorithm refers to the normal operation of the piece selection policy used in BitTorrent. It is also called the local rarest first algorithm. Each peer has a rarest pieces set. The rarest pieces are the pieces that have the least number of copies in the peer set. In general, right after being unchoked, the local peer randomly requests the next piece to download in its rarest pieces set. Rarest first Optimistically unchoked Each peer in a peer\u2019s neighbour list has two state bits: interested/uninterested: this bit tells us whether the neighbour is interested in the pieces we have got. choked/unchoked: this bit states whether we are currently choking the neighbour. Choking a peer means disallowing it to download pieces at this point in time. Peers send choke, unchoke, interested, and not interested messages to each other in the peer protocol. Choking works on a tit-for-tat basis: If we are currently downloading from a peer, we will unchoke that peer so that it may also download from us. This means, that when selecting a peer to download from, we should prefer peers that are interested in us. If a peer does not contribute (i.e., we are not able to download from it) we can choke it again. Optimistic unchoke : It is a strategy to choose peers to cooperate with. One or more peers will be optimistically unchoked at all time. This role rotates every 30 seconds. If an optimistically unchoked peer start contributing, it may stay unchoked. Replacing contributing peers, if an optimistic unchoke results in a peer that is performing better (yielding faster download rates), one of the currently unchoked peers will be replaced. Choked/unchoked state of neighbours is reconsidered every 10 seconds. At any point in time a peer should have a number of unchoked neighbours. Some implementations have a static value of 4, whereas others use the square root of the upload capacity in KB/s Optimistically unchoked Leech Leech has two meanings. Often, leecher is synonymous with downloader (see above): simply describing a peer or any client that does not have 100% of the data. The term leech also refers to a peer (or peers) that has a negative effect on the swarm by having a very poor share ratio, downloading much more than they upload. Leeches may be on asymmetric Internet connections or do not leave their BitTorrent client open to seed the file after their download has completed. However, some leeches intentionally avoid uploading by using modified clients or excessively limiting their upload speed. Leech Bittorrent glossary Seed / Seeding A seed refers to a machine possessing all of the data (100 % completion). A peer or downloader becomes a seed when it completely downloads all the data and continues/starts uploading data for other peers to download from. This includes any peer possessing 100% of the data or a web seed. When a downloader starts uploading content, the peer becomes a seed DNS The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. DNS services: hostname-to.IP-address translation host aliasing (canonical, alias names) mail server aliasing load distribution (replicated Web servers: many IP address correspond to one name) DNS DNS records Distributed database storing resource records(RR) in format: (name, value, type, ttl) Type Name Value A Hostname Ip address NS domain (foo.com) hostname of authoritative NS for this domain CNAME alias name for some \"canonical\" (the real) name canonical name MX name of SMTP mail server associated with name Difference between iterative and recursive calling Iterative Iterative DNS queries are ones in which a DNS server is queried and returns an answer without querying other DNS servers, even if it cannot provide a definitive answer. Iterative queries are also called non-recursive queries. Recursive Recursive DNS queries occur when a DNS client requests information from a DNS server that is set to query subsequent DNS servers until a definitive answer is returned to the client. The queries made to subsequent DNS servers from the first DNS server are iterative queries. Scenarios where recursive calling is relevant Recursive DNS queries generally tend to resolve faster than iterative queries. This is due to caching. A recursive DNS server caches the final answer to every query it performs and saves that final answer for a certain amount of time (known as the Time-To-Live). Why hierarchical database? In order to deal with the issue of scale. Page 164 Local DNS server - replies to DNS query by local host, by contacting other DNS servers to answer the query Root servers - highest level of DNS hierarchy, know how to reach servers responsible for a given domain(e.g. .com, .edu) TLD servers (Top-level domain) -responsible for a domain (e.g., .com, .edu); knows how to contact authoritative name servers Authoritative DNS servers - provide authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's named hosts What is a DNS caching? DNS cache refers to the temporary storage of information about previous DNS lookups Compare P2P with server Client architecture Peer-to-peer networks connect computers so that each computer shares all or part of its resources. Client-server networks have one or more central computers, or servers, that hold the data and manage resources. How does DASH work? HTTP-based streaming, often referred to as Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). In DASH, the video is encoded into several different versions, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level. The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate version. The client selects different chunks one at a time with HTTP GET request messages. With DASH, each video version is stored in the HTTP server, each with a different URL. The HTTP server also has a manifest file, which provides a URL for each version along with its bit rate. The client first requests the manifest file and learns about the various versions. The client then selects one chunk at a time by specifying a URL and a byte range in an HTTP GET request message for each chunk. While downloading chunks, the client also measures the received bandwidth and runs a rate determination algorithm to select the chunk to request next. Naturally, if the client has a lot of video buffered and if the measured receive bandwidth is high, it will choose a chunk from a high-bitrate version. And naturally if the client has little video buffered and the measured received bandwidth is low, it will choose a chunk from a low-bitrate version. DASH therefore allows the client to freely switch among different quality levels.","title":"Application layer"},{"location":"application/#application-layer","text":"","title":"Application layer"},{"location":"application/#server-client","text":"In a client-server architecture , there is an always-on host, called the server, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients.

Get close to end users Instead of getting inside the access ISP, these CDNs typically place their clusters in IXPs Advantages Improves user-perceived delay and throughput by decreasing the number of links and routers between the end user and the CDN server from which it receives content Lower maintenance and management overhead Disadv. maintain and manage the clusters can become challenging because of this highly distributed design higher delay and lower throughput to end users How it operates Most CDNs take advantage of DNS to intercept and redirect requests; CDN learns the IP address of the client\u2019s local DNS (LDNS) server via the client\u2019s DNS lookup. After learning this IP address, the CDN needs to select an appropriate cluster based on this IP address. CDNs generally employ proprietary cluster selection strategies: geographically closest or by performing real-time measurements of delay and loss performance. My thoughts : if client updates anything so it updates at origin server, CDN used only for fetching content. So the user fetches first the content from CDN server and if he/she needs update anything it updates direct to orgin server(the address could still be CDN server, but it will redirect to origin server) Google' CDN - three tiers of server clusters Netflix","title":"CDN"},{"location":"application/#enter-deep","text":"a CDN approach that stores content in access networks, close to clients","title":"Enter deep"},{"location":"application/#centralized-architecture-vs-distributed-architecture","text":"Security : CENTRALIZED: If someone has access to the server with the information, any data can be added, modified and deleted. DISTRIBUTED: All data is distributed between the nodes of the network. If something is added, edited or deleted in any computer, it will be reflected in all the computers in the network. If some legal amendments are accepted, new information will be disseminated among other users throughout the network. Otherwise, the data will be copied to match the other nodes. Therefore, the system is self-sufficient and self-regulating. The databases are protected against deliberate attacks or accidental changes of information. Availability : CENTRALIZED: If there are several requests, the server can break down and no longer respond. DISTRIBUTED: Can withstand significant pressure on the network. All the nodes in the network have the data. Then, the requests are distributed among the nodes. Therefore, the pressure does not fall on a computer, but on the entire network. In this case, the total availability of the network is much greater than in the centralized one. Accessibility : CENTRALIZED: If the central storage has problems, you will not be able to obtain your information unless the problems are solved. In addition, different users have different needs, but the processes are standardized and can be inconvenient for customers. DISTRIBUTED: Given that the number of computers in the distributed network is large, DDoS attacks are possible only in case their capacity is much greater than that of the network. But that would be a very expensive attack. In a centralized model, the response time is very similar in this case. Therefore, it can be considered that distributed networks are secure. Data transfer rates: CENTRALIZED: If the nodes are located in different countries or continents, the connection with the server can become a problem. DISTRIBUTED: In distributed networks, the client can choose the node and work with all the required information. Scalability: CENTRALIZED: Centralized networks are difficult to scale because the capacity of the server is limited and the traffic can not be infinite. In a centralized model, all clients are connected to the server. Only the server stores all the data. Therefore, all requests to receive, change, add or delete data go through the main computer. But server resources are finite. As a result, he is able to carry out his work effectively only for the specific number of participants. If the number of clients is greater, the server load may exceed the limit during the peak time.

Choking a peer means disallowing it to download pieces at this point in time. Peers send choke, unchoke, interested, and not interested messages to each other in the peer protocol. Choking works on a tit-for-tat basis: If we are currently downloading from a peer, we will unchoke that peer so that it may also download from us. This means, that when selecting a peer to download from, we should prefer peers that are interested in us. If a peer does not contribute (i.e., we are not able to download from it) we can choke it again. Optimistic unchoke : It is a strategy to choose peers to cooperate with. One or more peers will be optimistically unchoked at all time. This role rotates every 30 seconds. If an optimistically unchoked peer start contributing, it may stay unchoked. Replacing contributing peers, if an optimistic unchoke results in a peer that is performing better (yielding faster download rates), one of the currently unchoked peers will be replaced.

In DASH, the video is encoded into several different versions, with each version having a different bit rate and, correspondingly, a different quality level. The client dynamically requests chunks of video segments of a few seconds in length. When the amount of available bandwidth is high, the client naturally selects chunks from a high-rate version; and when the available bandwidth is low, it naturally selects from a low-rate version. The client selects different chunks one at a time with HTTP GET request messages. With DASH, each video version is stored in the HTTP server, each with a different URL. The HTTP server also has a manifest file, which provides a URL for each version along with its bit rate. The client first requests the manifest file and learns about the various versions. The client then selects one chunk at a time by specifying a URL and a byte range in an HTTP GET request message for each chunk. While downloading chunks, the client also measures the received bandwidth and runs a rate determination algorithm to select the chunk to request next. Naturally, if the client has a lot of video buffered and if the measured receive bandwidth is high, it will choose a chunk from a high-bitrate version. And naturally if the client has little video buffered and the measured received bandwidth is low, it will choose a chunk from a low-bitrate version.

The most important of these delays are the nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay and propagation delay . TCP/IP protocol stack It is conceptual model and set of communications protocols used in the Internet. TCP/IP TCP/IP protocol stack Denial-of-service (DoS) Denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. DoS DDoS Distributed denial-of-service attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. DDoS Packet sniffing Packet sniffing is the practice of gathering, collecting, and logging some or all packets that pass through a computer network, regardless of how the packet is addressed. In this way, every packet, or a defined subset of packets, may be gathered for further analysis. Packet sniffing Man-in-the-middle attack Cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other. MITM Circuit switching The switches on the path between the sender and receiver maintain connection state for that connection. In the jargon of telephony, this connection is called a circuit. End-to-end routing The end-to-end routing process is analogous to a car driver who does not use maps but instead prefers to ask for directions. Page 53 Link The term link is widely used in computer networking to refer to the communications facilities that connect nodes of a network. Link Multiplexing Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple data streams over a single medium. Mutiplexing Throughput vs Bandwidth vs Latency Throughput rate (bit/time unit) at which bits are being send from sender to receiver instantaneous: rate at given point in time(Many applications, including many P2P file sharing \u00ad systems, display the instantaneous throughput during downloads in the user interface) average: rate over longer period of time Throughput is always less than or equal to bandwidth but can never exceed bandwidth. In a computer network, the throughput can be affected by many factors as listed below: Network congestion due to heavy network usage. Too many users are accessing the same server. Low bandwidth allocation between network devices. Medium loss of a computer network. Resources (CPU, RAM) of network devices. So even if you have a high bandwidth to your ISP, it may not guarantee that you will have a high throughput due to the above factors. Bandwidth In computer network, bandwidth is defined as the maximum number of bits that can flow through a network connection in a given period of time. The fundamental unit of network bandwidth is bits per second (bps). An ISP network connection that specified a bandwidth of 1Mbps means that in one second, maximum 100000 bits can be transferred across this connection. The term bandwidth is normally used in internet broadband subscription plan. Normally a higher bandwidth subscription plan will cost more than that of a lower bandwidth subscription plan. Bandwidth Latency Latency measures delay . Delay is simply the time taken for a data packet to reach its destination after being sent. We measure network latency as round trips, although it may sometimes be measured in one-way trips. However, round-trip measurements are more common, because devices usually wait for an acknowledgment from the destination machine to be returned before transmitting the complete set of data. This acknowledgment verifies the connection to the destination device. If your network is experiencing high levels of latency, this signals poor or slow network performance. In short, the higher your network delay and latency, the longer it will take for a data packet to reach the appropriate destination. The result of latency is often choppy and lagging services. This might manifest as poor-quality VoIP calls, where elements of speech are missing or there is a noticeable lag.

Counting to infinity is just another name for a routing loop. In distance vector routing, routing loops usually occur when an interface goes down. It can also occur when two routers send updates to each other at the same time. As you see in this graph, there is only one link between A and the other parts of the network. Now imagine that the link between A and B is cut. At this time, B corrects its table. After a specific amount of time, routers exchange their tables, and so B receives C's routing table. Since C doesn't know what has happened to the link between A and B, it says that it has a link to A with the weight of 2 (1 for C to B, and 1 for B to A -- it doesn't know B has no link to A). B receives this table and thinks there is a separate link between C and A, so it corrects its table and changes infinity to 3 (1 for B to C, and 2 for C to A, as C said). Once again, routers exchange their tables. When C receives B's routing table, it sees that B has changed the weight of its link to A from 1 to 3, so C updates its table and changes the weight of the link to A to 4 (1 for C to B, and 3 for B to A, as B said). This process loops until all nodes find out that the weight of link to A is infinity. Datagram The Internet\u2019s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagrams from one host to another. Autonomous systems (ASs) Group of routers in a region In order to solve scalability problems routers are organized into Autonomous Systems( ASs ) with each AS consisting of a group of routers that are under the same administrative control. Routers within the same AS all run the same routing algorithm and have information about each other. Why different Intra and Inter AS routing? Policy We ant to enforce different policies on different levels of our netwroks Scale Hierarchical routing in order to reduce the amount of updates we need to send everybody Save table size Performance In Intra performance is really important In Inter maybe policy would be more important than performance Intra AS routing Intra - is a prefix which means within or inside one group. Intra autonomous system is the routing algorithm running within an AS Routers in the same AS have to run the same routing protocols Common Intra-AS Routing protocols/ Interior gateway protocol RIP: Routing Information Protocol Distance Vector Algorithm Distance Metric number of hops (number of subnets) max = 15hops Response Message (or Advertisements) - sends DV Link Failure and Recovery: No Advertisement in 180sec = You're Dead RIP table processing route**d** UDP advertisiments OSPF: Open Shortest Path First Link state Dijkstra algorithm Advertisements Straight IP datagrams, not UDP Security All messages authenticated Multiple same cost paths Multiple cost metrics Integrated multicast multiple messages to multiple recipients Hierarchical OSPF 2 level Hierarchy Local Area Backbone EIGRP: Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol Inter AS routing Inter - is a prefix that means between two groups Routers in different ASs could run on different routing protocols BGP Routing among the ISPs Border Gateway Protocol The de facto standard Allows AS to Obtain Subnet Reachability Information Propagate Reachability Information to Internal Routers Determine Good Routes to External Subnets Reachability information Policy Destinations are prefixes NOT Hosts Prefix + Attributes = Route Advertised prefix includes BGP attributes 2 Important Attributes AS-PATH - path of AS that you have to pass in order to get to this prefix NEXT-HOP - IP address of the router interface that begins the AS-PATH Route Selection Local Preferences Value Attribute: Policy Decision Shortest AS-PATH Closest NEXT-HOP router: Hot potato routing Additional criteria BGP Messages Messages exchanged using TCP Types OPEN: opens TCP connection to peer and authenticate sender UPDATE: advertises new path(or withdraws old) KEEPALIVE: keeps connection alive in absence of UPDATES; also ACKs OPEN request NOTIFICATION: reports error in previous msg, also used to close connection iBGP vs eBGP BGP Peer BGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among routers to create a TCP session on port 179. Two differenr BGP Sessions: iBGP eBGP Internal BGP External BGP When BGP runs between two peers in the same autonomous system (AS) When it runs between different autonomous systems BGP Routing Policy B shouldn't advertise path BAW to C, because B does not want to provide service for C when C can be get through A , so any routes that can be gotten to through other means we'd prefer that, because then B wasting its bandwidth Gateway routers Router that connects ASs have to use them if we have external destination Hot Potato Routing One of the simplest BGP routing algorithms ICMP Internet control message protocol is used by hosts and routers to communicate network layer information to each other. The most typical use of ICMP is for error reporting SNMP SNMP is an application-layer protocol used to convey netwrokd-management control and information messages between a managing server and an agent executing on behalf of the managing server SDN Software-defined networking ( SDN ) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management Key characteristics of an SDN architecture: Packet forwarding can be based on any number of header fields. Rules are specified in a switch's flow table; it is the job of the SDN control plane to compute, manage and install flow table entries in all of the network switches Separation of data plane and control plane The data plane consists of the network switches- relatively simple(but fast) devices that execute the \"match+action\" rules in their flow tables. The control plane consists of servers and software that determine and manage the switches flow table Network control functions: external to data-plane switches The control plane itself consists of two components SDN controller - maintains accurate network state information Set of network control applications - Access control, Routing, Load balancer Programmable network The network is programmable through the network control applications running in the control plane. E.g. routing with Dijkstra algorithm That's data plane switches, SDN controllers and network control applications are separate entities. A controllers functionality can be organized into three layers: Forwarding Forwarding has two main operations: match and action. Match + action Match bits in arriving packet, take action Destination based forwarding Generalized forwarding Forward based on dest. IP address Many headers can determine action Many actions possible: drop/copy/modify/log packet Generalized forwarding Replaces Decision based forwarding Many more fields than destination address can be consulted and much wider range of actions Match+action OpenFlow - emerging standard for generalized forwarding Simple packet handling rules Match Pattern values in packet header fields Actions For matched packet: drop, forward, modify(e.g. NAT), matched packet or send matched packet to controller Priority Disambiguate overlapping patterns Counters #bytes and #packets OpenFlow Specific generalized forwarding, that has been standardized Unifies different kinds of devices Device Match Action Router Longest destination IP prefix Forward out a link Switch Destination MAC address Forward or flood Firewall IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers Permit or dent NAT IP address and port Rewrite address and port No need for routing protocols, because forwarding tables are computes in the SDN controller Hop A hop is a computer networking term that refers to the number of routers that a packet (a portion of data) passes through from its source to its destination.

Counting to infinity is just another name for a routing loop. In distance vector routing, routing loops usually occur when an interface goes down. It can also occur when two routers send updates to each other at the same time. As you see in this graph, there is only one link between A and the other parts of the network. Now imagine that the link between A and B is cut. At this time, B corrects its table. After a specific amount of time, routers exchange their tables, and so B receives C's routing table. Since C doesn't know what has happened to the link between A and B, it says that it has a link to A with the weight of 2 (1 for C to B, and 1 for B to A -- it doesn't know B has no link to A). B receives this table and thinks there is a separate link between C and A, so it corrects its table and changes infinity to 3 (1 for B to C, and 2 for C to A, as C said). Once again, routers exchange their tables. When C receives B's routing table, it sees that B has changed the weight of its link to A from 1 to 3, so C updates its table and changes the weight of the link to A to 4 (1 for C to B, and 3 for B to A, as B said).

And there is also delay to inform others about abortion. Routing algorithms How does Dijkstra Algorithm work? The main idea to keep the best path found until now and the reference to previous vertex. Let distance of start vertex from start vertex = 0 Let distances of all other vertices from start = infinity WHILE vertices remain unvisited Visit univisted vertex with smallest known distance from start vertex FOR EACH univisited neighbour of the current vertex Calculate the distance from start vertex IF the calculated distance of this vertex is less than the known distance Update shortest distance this vertex Update the previous vertex with the current vertex END IF Add the current vertex on the list of visited vertices END WHILE Youtube Dijkstra algorithm How does Bellman - ford(Distance Vector) work? The current node only know the distances to neighbors and the shortest paths to all other nodes from these neighbors. By using this information and the equation below we can decide which path we should take: $$ d_x(y) = min_v[c(x,v)+d_v(y)] $$ Annotation Description c(x,v) c(x,v) cost from x to v d_x(y) d_x(y) cost of least-cost path from x to y min_v min_v min is taken over all neighbors v of x That's, how much it will cost if I take through this node, because I know my distance to it and his distances to all other nodes. Each neighbor see what his neighbors see. B-F Equation example d_v(z)=5 d_v(z)=5 d_x(z)=3 d_x(z)=3 d_w(z)=3 d_w(z)=3 $$ d_x(y) = min_v[c(u,v)+d_v(z), c(u,x)+d_x(z), c(u,w)+d_w(z)] = \\ min_v[2+5, 1+3, 5+3] = 4 $$ Maintains D_x=[D_x(y):y\\in N] D_x=[D_x(y):y\\in N] - Node x maintains its own distance vector D_v=[D_v(y):y\\in N] D_v=[D_v(y):y\\in N] - Node x also maintains distance vectors for each neighbor v DV is big as nodes in the network Overview Send DV to Neighbors.

TCP uses virtual ports to create a virtual end-to-end connection that can reuse the physical connections between two computers. TCP encapsulates higher level protocol data such as HTTP and, SMTP (email). TCP It is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. TCP TCP Handshake The TCP three-way handshake, also called the TCP-handshake, three message handshake, and/or SYN-SYN-ACK, is the method used by TCP to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP-based network. The three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session are nicknamed SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK for SYNchronize, SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement, and ACKnowledge. The three message mechanism is designed for the two computers that want to pass information back and forth and can negotiate the parameters of the connection before transmitting data such as HTTP browser requests.

It involves minimum amount of communication mechanism. UDP is said to be an unreliable transport protocol but it uses IP services which provides best effort delivery mechanism. In UDP, the receiver does not generate an acknowledgement of packet received and in turn, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgement of packet sent. This shortcoming makes this protocol unreliable as well as easier on processing. UDP tutorialspoint Connectionless TCP vs UDP TCP UDP TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission. TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router. The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums. Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver. There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP. Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. There is no retransmission of lost packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP has a (20-80) bytes variable length header. UDP has a 8 bytes fixed length header. TCP is heavy-weight. UDP is lightweight. TCP doesn\u2019t supports Broadcasting. UDP supports Broadcasting. TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP and Telnet. UDP is used by DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, and VoIP. TCP vs UDP Multiplexing vs Demultiplexing Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing. At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identidy the receiving socket and then directs the segments to the that socket. This job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is called demultiplexing . The job of gathering data chunks at he source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information(that will later be used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer is called multipplexing . Multiplexing Demultiplexing Where At sender At receiver Function Handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header Use header info to deliver received segments to correct sockets UDP Using destination port number(only) TCP Using 4-tuple: source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers CheckSum Checksum is the error detection method used by upper layer protocols. UDP TCP Entire UDP segment, except the checksum field itself, and the IP sender and receive address fields(violates layering) What kind of errors can go undetected? If the corresponding bits are damaged of opposite sides. E.g. 1 st bit of subunit 1 is damaged and 1 st bit of subunit 2 is damaged Reliable Data transfer Number Feature/ Recover from 1.0 Send+receive 2.0 + Bit errors 2.1 + Sequence number(duplicates) 2.2 + Without NAK 3.0 + Packet lost Reliable data transfer protocols (RDT, RDP) are algorithmic measures to provide assurances of the reliable transfer of data across a network that may be subject to data loss and/or corruption. RDT involves sender-side and receiver-side sequences and variables to validate, acknowledge, and retransmit data when necessary. The goal of RDT protocols is to provide network and link layer service such that application and transport layer services can make guarantees about data delivery. Reliable Data Transfer Protocols must address the two primary concerns of data loss and data corruption . In network communications, these types of errors generally occur on the physical network hardware during buffering, propagation, and transmission actions. To address these concerns, senders and receivers need a way to communicate indirectly with respect to the receipt and validation of data being transmitted. In such cases where data has been lost or corrupted, RDT protocols dictate that data should be re-transmitted. At the most basic level, this introduces another concern of duplicate data into the mix. Data loss and corruption are the two primary concerns RDT seeks to address. The concern of duplicate data only arises through actions taken to address these first two concerns. As such, considering the issues of loss and corruption is a sensible place to begin considering the underlying function of RDT. RDT For connection-oriented service provided by TCP, it is necessary to have a reliable data transfer (RDT) protocol to ensure delivery of all packets and to enable the receiver to deliver the packets in order to its application layer. A simple alternating bit RDT protocol can be designed using some basic tools. This protocol is also known as a stop-and-wait protocol: after sending each packet the sender stops and waits for feedback from the receiver indicating that the packet has been received. Stop-and-wait RDT protocols have poor performance in a long-distance connection. At best, the sender can only transmit one packet per round-trip time. For a 1000 mile connection this amounts to approximately 1 packet (about 1500 bytes) every 20 ms. That results in a pathetic 75 KB per second rate. To improve transmission rates, a realistic RDT protocol must use pipelining. This allows the sender to have a large number of packets \"in the pipeline\". This phrase refers to packets that have been sent but whose receipt has not yet verified by the receiver. Reliable data transfer How can a protocol recover from errors? We need some feedback from receiver. Acknowledgements: ACKs - I got a packet OK Negative acknowledgement NAKs: A Packet was corrupted. Retransmission, if NAK How can it detect duplicates? Checking sequence number 0 or 1. Because there can only be one packet out at the time. If receiver get a duplicate just discard it. How can it recover from lost packets? Have timer and if in given time, ACK isn't received send a packet again How can it increase the link Utilization? Pipelined Protocol. Send out multiple packet in batch on the pipe before any ACK received yet. Go-back-N , says I have all the packets until N. Transmits all the packets after N (the last received) Selective Repeat, I didn't received that packet that and that packet. That's transmits only unACKed packets. Pipelining A pipeline sender can have transmitted multiple packets for which the sender has yet to recive an ACK from the receiver With a pipelined sender, there may be transmitted packets \"in flight\" - propagating through the channel - that the receiver has not yet received. Go-back-N vs Selective repeat Go-Back-N Protocol Selective Repeat Protocol In Go-Back-N Protocol, if the sent frame are find suspected then all the frames are re-transmitted from the lost packet to the last packet transmitted. In selective Repeat protocol, only those frames are re-transmitted which are found suspected. Sender window size of Go-Back-N Protocol is N. Sender window size of selective Repeat protocol is also N. Receiver window size of Go-Back-N Protocol is 1. Receiver window size of selective Repeat protocol is N. Go-Back-N Protocol is less complex. Selective Repeat protocol is more complex. In Go-Back-N Protocol, neither sender nor at receiver need sorting. In selective Repeat protocol, receiver side needs sorting to sort the frames. In Go-Back-N Protocol, type of Acknowledgement is cumulative. In selective Repeat protocol, type of Acknowledgement is individual. In Go-Back-N Protocol, Out-of-Order packets are NOT Accepted (discarded) and the entire window is re-transmitted. In selective Repeat protocol, Out-of-Order packets are Accepted. In Go-Back-N Protocol, if Receives receives a corrupt packet, then also, the entire window is re-transmitted. In selective Repeat protocol, if Receives receives a corrupt packet, it immediately sends a negative acknowledgement and hence only the selective packet is retransmitted. Cumulative ACK A cumulative ACK(n) acks all packets with sequence number up to and including n as being received Connection-oriented Handshaking Flow control vs Congestion control Flow control Congestion control Speed matching between single sender and single receiver Multiple senders Network-assisted vs end-end congestion control Network-assisted End-end A router marks a field in the datagram header at a congested router the network layer provides no explicit support to the transport layer for congestion-control purposes.

Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission. TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router. The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums. Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver. There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. TCP is comparatively slower than UDP. UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP. Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. There is no retransmission of lost packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

RDT involves sender-side and receiver-side sequences and variables to validate, acknowledge, and retransmit data when necessary. The goal of RDT protocols is to provide network and link layer service such that application and transport layer services can make guarantees about data delivery. Reliable Data Transfer Protocols must address the two primary concerns of data loss and data corruption . In network communications, these types of errors generally occur on the physical network hardware during buffering, propagation, and transmission actions. To address these concerns, senders and receivers need a way to communicate indirectly with respect to the receipt and validation of data being transmitted. In such cases where data has been lost or corrupted, RDT protocols dictate that data should be re-transmitted. At the most basic level, this introduces another concern of duplicate data into the mix. Data loss and corruption are the two primary concerns RDT seeks to address. The concern of duplicate data only arises through actions taken to address these first two concerns. As such, considering the issues of loss and corruption is a sensible place to begin considering the underlying function of RDT. RDT For connection-oriented service provided by TCP, it is necessary to have a reliable data transfer (RDT) protocol to ensure delivery of all packets and to enable the receiver to deliver the packets in order to its application layer. A simple alternating bit RDT protocol can be designed using some basic tools. This protocol is also known as a stop-and-wait protocol: after sending each packet the sender stops and waits for feedback from the receiver indicating that the packet has been received. Stop-and-wait RDT protocols have poor performance in a long-distance connection. At best, the sender can only transmit one packet per round-trip time. For a 1000 mile connection this amounts to approximately 1 packet (about 1500 bytes) every 20 ms. That results in a pathetic 75 KB per second rate. To improve transmission rates, a realistic RDT protocol must use pipelining. This allows the sender to have a large number of packets \"in the pipeline\". This phrase refers to packets that have been sent but whose receipt has not yet verified by the receiver.

R4 For a P2P file-sharing application, do you agree with the statement, \u201cThere is no notion of client and server sides of a communication session\u201d? Why or why not? No. In a P2P file-sharing application, the peer that is receiving a file is typically the client and the peer that is sending the file is typically the server. R7 Referring to Figure 2.4 , we see that none of the applications listed in Figure 2.4 requires both no data loss and timing. Can you conceive of an application that requires no data loss and that is also highly time-sensitive? One such example is remote word processing, for example, with Google docs. However, because Google docs runs over the Internet (using TCP), timing guarantees are not provided. R9 Recall that TCP can be enhanced with SSL to provide process-to-process security services, including encryption. Does SSL operate at the transport layer or the application layer? If the application developer wants TCP to be enhanced with SSL, what does the developer have to do? SSL operates at the application layer. The SSL socket takes unencrypted data from the application layer, encrypts it and then passes it to the TCP socket. If the application developer wants TCP to be enhanced with SSL, she has to include the SSL code in the application. R10 What is meant by a handshaking protocol? A protocol uses handshaking if the two communicating entities first exchange control packets before sending data to each other. SMTP uses handshaking at the application layer whereas HTTP does not.

The applications associated with those protocols require that all application data be received in the correct order and without gaps. TCP provides this service whereas UDP does not.

When the user first visits the site, the server creates a unique identification number, creates an entry in its back-end database, and returns this identification number as a cookie number. This cookie number is stored on the user\u2019s host and is managed by the browser. During each subsequent visit (and purchase), the browser sends the cookie number back to the site. Thus the site knows when this user (more precisely, this browser) is visiting the site. R15 List several popular messaging apps. Do they use the same protocols as SMS?

Answer the following questions: a Explain the mechanism used for signaling between the client and server to indicate that a persistent connection is being closed. Can the client, the server, or both signal the close of a connection? Persistent connections are discussed in section 8 of RFC 2616 (the real goal of this question was to get you to retrieve and read an RFC). Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.2.1 of the RFC indicate that either the client or the server can indicate to the other that it is going to close the persistent connection. It does so by including the connection-token \"close\" in the Connection-header field of the http request/reply. b What encryption services are provided by HTTP? HTTP does not provide any encryption services. c Can a client open three or more simultaneous connections with a given server? (From RFC 2616) \u201cClients that use persistent connections should limit the number of simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy.\u201d d Either a server or a client may close a transport connection between them if either one detects the connection has been idle for some time. Is it possible that one side starts closing a connection while the other side is transmitting data via this connection? Explain. Yes.

Persistent connections are discussed in section 8 of RFC 2616 (the real goal of this question was to get you to retrieve and read an RFC). Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.2.1 of the RFC indicate that either the client or the server can indicate to the other that it is going to close the persistent connection.
