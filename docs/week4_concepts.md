## Bit error

Send 1 and received 0, but all packet are still delivered

## What are sockets

Doors through which data passes from the network to the process and through which data passes from the process to the network. 

## TCP

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a Transport Layer host-to-host protocol for **connection-oriented communication** between two computers on an IP network. TCP uses virtual ports to create a virtual end-to-end connection that can reuse the physical connections between two computers. TCP encapsulates higher level protocol data such as HTTP and, SMTP (email). [TCP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transmission_Control_Protocol_(TCP))  

- It is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. [TCP ](https://www.guru99.com/tcp-vs-udp-understanding-the-difference.html) 



### TCP Handshake
The TCP three-way handshake, also called the TCP-handshake, three message handshake, and/or SYN-SYN-ACK, is the method used by TCP to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP-based network. The three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session are nicknamed SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK for SYNchronize, SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement, and ACKnowledge. The three message mechanism is designed for the two computers that want to pass information back and forth and can negotiate the parameters of the connection before transmitting data such as HTTP browser requests.

## UDP

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is simplest Transport Layer communication protocol available of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It involves minimum amount of communication mechanism. UDP is said to be an unreliable transport protocol but it uses IP services which provides best effort delivery mechanism.

In UDP, the receiver does not generate an acknowledgement of packet received and in turn, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgement of packet sent. This shortcoming makes this protocol unreliable as well as easier on processing. [UDP tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_communication_computer_network/user_datagram_protocol.htm)

## TCP vs UDP

| TCP                                                          | UDP                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. | UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission. |
| TCP is reliable as it guarantees delivery of data to the destination router. | The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed in UDP. |
| TCP provides extensive error checking mechanisms. It is because it provides flow control and acknowledgment of data. | UDP has only the basic error checking mechanism using checksums. |
| Sequencing of data is a feature of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). this means that packets arrive in-order at the receiver. | There is no sequencing of data in UDP. If ordering is required, it has to be managed by the application layer. |
| TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.                        | UDP is faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP.          |
| Retransmission of lost packets is possible in TCP, but not in UDP. | There is no retransmission of lost packets in User Datagram Protocol (UDP). |
| TCP has a (20-80) bytes variable length header.              | UDP has a 8 bytes fixed length header.                       |
| TCP is heavy-weight.                                         | UDP is lightweight.                                          |
| TCP doesnâ€™t supports Broadcasting.                           | UDP supports Broadcasting.                                   |
| TCP is used by HTTP, HTTPs, FTP, SMTP and Telnet.            | UDP is used by DNS, DHCP, TFTP, SNMP, RIP, and VoIP.         |

## Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing. 
At the receiving end, the transport layer examines these fields to identidy the receiving socket and then directs the segments to the that socket. This job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is called **demultiplexing**. The job of gathering data chunks at he source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information(that will later be used in demultiplexing) to create segments, and passing the segments to the network layer is called **multipplexing**.  


## CheckSum

**Checksum** is the error detection method used by upper layer protocols.



- Example: If the data unit to be transmitted is 10101001 00111001, the following procedure is used at Sender site and Receiver site.

```
Sender Site:
10101001        subunit 1  
00111001        subunit 2        
11100010        sum (using 1s complement)       
00011101        checksum (complement of sum- that's swapping 0s and 1s)

_______________________________
Data   				| Checksum
--------------------|----------
10101001 00111001	| 00011101


Receiver Site:
10101001        subunit 1  
00111001        subunit 2     
00011101        checksum 
11111111        sum
00000000        sum's complement


```



### What kind of errors can go undetected?

If the corresponding bits are damaged of opposite sides. E.g. 1st bit of subunit 1 is damaged and 1st bit of subunit 2 is damaged


## Reliable Data transfer


Reliable data transfer protocols (RDT, RDP) are algorithmic measures to provide assurances of the reliable transfer of data across a network that may be subject to data loss and/or corruption. RDT involves sender-side and receiver-side sequences and variables to validate, acknowledge, and retransmit data when necessary.

The goal of RDT protocols is to provide network and link layer service such that application and transport layer services can make guarantees about data delivery.

Reliable Data Transfer Protocols must address the two primary concerns of **data loss** and **data corruption**. In network communications, these types of errors generally occur on the physical network hardware during buffering, propagation, and transmission actions.

To address these concerns, senders and receivers need a way to communicate *indirectly* with respect to the receipt and validation of data being transmitted. In such cases where data has been lost or corrupted, RDT protocols dictate that data should be re-transmitted. At the most basic level, this introduces another concern of **duplicate data** into the mix.

Data loss and corruption are the two primary concerns RDT seeks to address. The concern of duplicate data only arises through actions taken to address these first two concerns. As such, considering the issues of loss and corruption is a sensible place to begin considering the underlying function of RDT.

[RDT](https://medium.com/@zackofwest/reliable-data-transfer-protocols-rdt-the-reliability-guarantee-that-keeps-the-internet-running-e555a4fb375d)



For connection-oriented service provided by TCP, it is necessary to have a reliable data transfer (RDT) protocol to ensure delivery of all packets and to enable the receiver to deliver the packets in order to its application layer.

A simple alternating bit RDT protocol can be designed using some basic tools. This protocol is also known as a stop-and-wait protocol: after sending each packet the sender stops and waits for feedback from the receiver indicating that the packet has been received.

Stop-and-wait RDT protocols have poor performance in a long-distance connection. At best, the sender can only transmit one packet per round-trip time. For a 1000 mile connection this amounts to approximately 1 packet (about 1500 bytes) every 20 ms. That results in a pathetic 75 KB per second rate.

To improve transmission rates, a realistic RDT protocol must use pipelining. This allows the sender to have a large number of packets "in the pipeline". This phrase refers to packets that have been sent but whose receipt has not yet verified by the receiver.

### How can a protocol recover from errors?

- We need some feedback from receiver. 
  - Acknowledgements: ACKs - I got a packet OK
  -  Negative acknowledgement NAKs: A Packet was corrupted.
- Retransmission, if NAK

### How can it detect duplicates?

- Checking sequence number
  - 0 or 1. Because there can only be one packet out at the time. 
- If receiver get a duplicate just discard it. 

### How can it recover from lost packets?

- Have timer and if in given time, ACK isn't received send a packet again

### How can it increase the link Utilization?

- Pipelined Protocol. Send out multiple packet in batch on the pipe before any ACK received yet. 
- Go-back-N , says I have all the packets until N.  Transmits all the packets after N (the last received)
- Selective Repeat, I didn't received that packet that and that packet. That's transmits only unACKed packets.
